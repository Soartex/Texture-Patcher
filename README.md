## Texture Pack Patcher

### _Original by REDX36, modified by Chefe_

See [soartex website](http://soartex.net/patcher) for more information.

I forked the original Patcher because I prefer a gradle based build and want to modify some stuff based on my personal preferences.

To use this project, just clone the repository and run (make sure you have at least a gradle wrapper installed)

```
gradle clean assemble
```

The patcher uses the default soartex files for now.
